![mlops-aws-sap-bw4hana drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/971f5331-1f73-480b-ad09-87e6ee02a849)

## **Overview**  
This architecture diagram represents a **hub-and-spoke network topology** on Azure, enabling high availability, scalability, and secure connectivity for applications hosted in a portal workload virtual network. It includes integration with on-premises resources, secure storage, monitoring, and load balancing.

The system is designed to serve users globally with an efficient and secure routing mechanism using **Azure Front Door** and **private networking** features.

---

## **Architecture Breakdown**

### **1. User Access via Azure Front Door**  
- **Azure Front Door** is used to securely route HTTP/HTTPS traffic from end-users to the application servers.  
- It provides **global load balancing, acceleration, and traffic optimization** for a seamless user experience.  

---

### **2. Hub Virtual Network**  

The **Hub Virtual Network** acts as the central point for connectivity, management, and monitoring.  

#### **a. Connectivity**  
- **VPN Gateway**: Connects on-premises datacenter resources to Azure over a **VPN** for hybrid connectivity.  
- **Azure Bastion**: Secure remote management for VMs without exposing public IPs.  
- **Gateway**: Routes traffic from on-premises to the workload virtual network via **Virtual Network Peering**.  

#### **b. Monitoring & Insights**  
- **Azure Monitor**: Tracks metrics and logs for performance, availability, and diagnostics.  
- **Microsoft Power BI**: Provides business intelligence and reporting capabilities.  

#### **c. Disaster Recovery**  
- **Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery**: Ensures data backup and disaster recovery for workloads hosted in Azure.  

---

### **3. Portal Workload Virtual Network**  

The **Portal Workload Virtual Network** hosts the core application servers in a secure and isolated subnet.  

#### **a. Application Tier**  
- **Portal Application Servers**: Deployed in high availability across multiple instances for scalability.  
- Connected to the database tier using **Private Link Endpoint** to ensure secure and private communication.

#### **b. Subnet Architecture**  
- An **Application Tier Subnet** isolates application servers to reduce attack surfaces and enable fine-grained network policies.  

---

### **4. Database and Storage**  

The **data tier** consists of managed Azure services for storage and database operations:  
- **Azure SQL Database**: Managed database service for storing application data with high availability.  
- **Azure Managed Disks**: Persistent storage for application servers or VMs.  
- **Azure Files**: Provides file shares for distributed workloads or configurations.  
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secures secrets, keys, and certificates for application-level security.  
- Communication between workloads and data services is secured using **Azure Private Link**.

---

### **5. On-Premises Integration**  
- The on-premises datacenter connects to Azure through a **VPN Gateway**, enabling hybrid workloads and secure connectivity.  
- Resources in the datacenter can interact with Azure-hosted applications and databases as part of the **hub-and-spoke** network design.  

---

## **Key Features**  
1. **Global Availability**:  
   - **Azure Front Door** ensures traffic is routed efficiently to the portal application servers.  

2. **Hybrid Connectivity**:  
   - Secure VPN Gateway links on-premises resources with Azure virtual networks.  

3. **Scalability and Isolation**:  
   - Portal application servers are hosted in a dedicated virtual network and subnet to provide isolation and scalability.  

4. **Secure Private Networking**:  
   - Azure **Private Link** secures traffic between workloads and data services.  

5. **Monitoring and Disaster Recovery**:  
   - Azure Monitor and Azure Site Recovery ensure visibility and fault tolerance.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Azure Front Door**: Global load balancing and acceleration.  
- **Azure VNet**: Hub-and-spoke network architecture.  
- **VPN Gateway**: Hybrid cloud connectivity.  
- **Azure Bastion**: Secure remote VM access.  
- **Azure Monitor**: Logs and performance monitoring.  
- **Azure SQL Database**: Managed relational database.  
- **Azure Files**: Cloud-based file storage.  
- **Azure Managed Disks**: Persistent disk storage for VMs.  
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secure secrets management.  
- **Azure Private Link**: Secure communication between services.  
- **Azure Backup and Site Recovery**: Backup and disaster recovery solutions.

## **How to Deploy**  
1. **Hub Network Deployment**  
   - Deploy the **Hub VNet** with a VPN Gateway, Bastion, and monitoring tools.  

2. **Portal Workload Network Setup**  
   - Create the **spoke VNet** for application servers.  
   - Configure Virtual Network Peering between the hub and workload VNets.  

3. **Deploy Application Servers**  
   - Provision VMs or containerized services in the **Application Tier Subnet**.  

4. **Database and Storage Integration**  
   - Set up **Azure SQL Database** and integrate **Private Link Endpoints** for secure access.  
   - Configure Azure Files and Key Vault for storage and secrets management.  

5. **Connect On-Premises**  
   - Establish VPN connectivity between the datacenter and Azure using the VPN Gateway.  

6. **Monitoring and Recovery**  
   - Enable **Azure Monitor** for logs and metrics.  
   - Set up Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery.
